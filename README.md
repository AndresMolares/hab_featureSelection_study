## Abstract

Harmful algal bloom are a global environmental issue that impact marine ecosystems and human health. To mitigate their effects, prediction through machine learning models has emerged as a promising approach. In this work, a feature selection process preceded the evaluation of three machine learning models, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), used to predict the lipophilic toxin-producing phytoplankton, Dinophysis acuminata, the causative agent of Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning. Predictions were conducted in outer and inner regions of the three southernmost Galician Rías Baixas (NW Spain): Ría de Arousa, Pontevedra and Vigo. It is one of the main mussel-producing regions in the world, where a weekly cells count monitoring program tracks the presence of this species. The use of features obtained from a 3D hydrodynamic model, CROCO, helped to compensate for the lack of a long-term and spatially extensive time series. Our results show that RF provides better prediction results compared to SVM and ANN. Among all the set of features tested, a larger number was required to achieve good predictions in the outer regions of the Ría de Pontevedra and Vigo compared to the other stations at the Ría de Arousa and at the inner Ría de Pontevedra and Vigo, where only five features were needed. The workflow followed in this study could be operationally applied to assist decision-makers involved in the management of shellfish production.
